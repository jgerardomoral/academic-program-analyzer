# Python 3.13 Compatibility Notes

## Current Status

This project is running on **Python 3.13**, which is very recent (released October 2024). Some scientific computing libraries have not yet released fully compatible versions.

## Packages Temporarily Disabled

### 1. `gensim` (Topic Modeling)
- **Issue**: Compilation errors with C/C++ extensions on Python 3.13
- **Impact**: None - we use `scikit-learn`'s `LatentDirichletAllocation` and `NMF` instead
- **Workaround**: All topic modeling functionality works via scikit-learn
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional without gensim

### 2. `streamlit-extras` (UI Enhancements)
- **Issue**: Dependency on packages that don't support Python 3.13 yet
- **Impact**: Minor - some extra UI components not available
- **Workaround**: Use standard Streamlit components
- **Status**: ⚠️ Optional features disabled

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Continue with Python 3.13 (Current)
- All core functionality works
- Minor UI limitations
- Will improve as libraries update

### Option 2: Downgrade to Python 3.11 or 3.12 (Recommended for Production)
If you need `streamlit-extras` or full ecosystem compatibility:

```bash
# Install Python 3.11 or 3.12 from python.org
# Then create a new virtual environment:
py -3.11 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## What Works Perfectly

✅ PDF extraction (pdfplumber)
✅ Text preprocessing (spaCy)
✅ Frequency analysis (scikit-learn)
✅ Topic modeling (scikit-learn LDA/NMF)
✅ Skills mapping
✅ Streamlit core functionality
✅ All visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
✅ All data processing (pandas, numpy, scipy)
✅ Testing framework (pytest)

## Future Updates

As of October 2024, Python 3.13 is very new. By early 2025, most packages should have full support. Monitor:
- `gensim` issue tracker: https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/issues
- `streamlit-extras` compatibility

## Installation Command

```bash
# Current working setup for Python 3.13:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all compatible packages and skip the problematic ones.
